#we first need to add them to staging area by

#if we change some file in our working directory and type git status then a message shows up modified : filename

#now we can commit

then git thinks that we deleted the original file and added the renamed file but they are the same file

#if we do
git add home.txt
git rm  first.txt
git status #now git figure out that we actually renamed the file 

git commit -m "renamed the first.txt to home.txt"

#really easy way
git mv second.txt pudding.txt #similar to renaming

#moving file to folder
#git mv pudding.txt LoveNotes/patty.txt #this move the pudding.txt to folder LoveNotes

git commit -m "renamed file pudding.txt to LoveNotes/patty.txt"

#commit directly to repository
git status #two files are modifies
git commit -am "directly from working to repo" #instead of adding to staging directly to commit
# this -a commit all the things so if we want to change single file do not use this also 
use only if you are editing simple thing and not in situations like moving, renaming etc

#take files from repository and replace them with our working copy which are messed up somehow

add new repository -> rename it -> give description -> create repository

#create connection between local git and online github there is a URL that we want to connect
so we need to add a remote and give a nickname to this URL

#push - add file to the server
#fetch - download thing from server
